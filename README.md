# Classic Slither.io

Imagine Slither.io, but with the classic Nokia 6110-style snake game.

## WebRTC:

The game operates without a backend, such as a WebSocket server; instead, it utilizes WebRTC to enable players to play with each other.

## Game mechanics:

### Types of snakes:

#### Flash:

The fastest snake in the game. (Moves 1.5x faster than the other snakes).

#### Bulldozer:

The opponent dies if he collides head on with this snake.

#### Wall rider:

This snake can't collide with the wall, if he does he comes out of the opposite wall.

### Types of food:

#### Protein:

The snake's body grows by 1 cell if he consumes this food.

#### Red bull:

The snake gains speed of 1.5x if he consumes this food.
